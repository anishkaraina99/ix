    <p>Hello! My name is Anishka. I am a rising junior at Cornell University and am double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering
     and Computer Science. Professionally, I am interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry as well as autonomous systems.
    On campus, I am on the controls subteam of my project team called Cornell Autoboat which builds an autonomous boat to complete challenges in the annual competition.
    In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and dancing. You can find my projects on GitHub. My username is <a href="https://github.com/anishkaraina99" target="_blank">anishkaraina99</a>.</p>
